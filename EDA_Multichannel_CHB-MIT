Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on CHB-MIT EEG Data

Project Overview
This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the chb01_01.edf file from the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database. The primary goal of this EDA is to prepare clean, structured EEG data for training deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs/RNNs) for seizure detection.


Dataset Used
Dataset: CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database (PhysioNet) 
Subject: chb01 (Patient 1) 
Files Analyzed: chb01_01.edf 
Sampling Rate: 256.0 Hz 
Channels: 23 EEG channels (bipolar derivations, mapped to approximate 10-20 system during montage application) 

Key EDA Steps & Findings

1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection
File: chb01_01.edf (23 EEG channels, 256 Hz sampling rate, ~4.4 minutes duration).
Issues: Duplicate channel names and invalid timestamps were observed.
Solutions: Channels were uniquely renamed (e.g., FP1-F7 → FP1). Metadata errors were ignored as they did not affect data quality.

2. Raw Signal Visualization
Observations: High-amplitude noise was present in low frequencies (<0.5 Hz) and muscle artifacts (>45 Hz). Line noise was also observed at 60 Hz.
Action: A bandpass filter (0.5–45 Hz) was applied to remove this noise.

3. Channel Management
Renamed Channels: Bipolar names (e.g., FP1-F7) were converted to single-electrode names.
Applied 10-20 Montage: Electrodes were mapped to standard scalp positions for spatial analysis.

4. Frequency Analysis (PSD & Topomaps)
Frequency Bands: Analyzed Delta (0.5–4 Hz), Theta (4–8 Hz), Alpha (8–12 Hz), Beta (13–30 Hz), and Gamma (30–45 Hz).
Key Findings:
Dominant power was observed in the Delta/Theta bands, typical for resting EEG.
Gamma power was localized to frontal/temporal regions, noted as a potential seizure indicator.

5. Data Segmentation
Epochs: Data was split into 10-second, non-overlapping windows by default.
Future Need: Using 50% overlapping windows is identified for improved model context and training sample size.
Critical Observations for Model Training (LSTM/RNN)
Class Imbalance: Seizure segments are rare, typically less than 5% of the data. 
Solution: Oversampling seizure events or using weighted loss functions will be crucial.
Input Shape: Each sample will have an input shape of (2560 timesteps, 23 channels) (10 sec × 256 Hz).
Preprocessing Impact: Filtering (0.5–45 Hz) significantly improves signal quality.
Normalization: Normalization is a crucial future step to stabilize model training.

Tools Used
Python Libraries: MNE-Python, NumPy, Matplotlib.
File Formats: Data was converted from EDF to FIF (MNE’s optimized format).
