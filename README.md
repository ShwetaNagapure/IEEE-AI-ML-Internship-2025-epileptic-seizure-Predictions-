## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project aims to explore and implement advanced AI/ML techniques for the  **prediction** of epileptic seizures using EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. The goal is to build robust, real-time models that can assist in early intervention and monitoring for individuals with epilepsy.

The project evaluates the effectiveness of various deep learning models on both **single-channel** and **multi-channel** EEG data.
